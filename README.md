# Elevate Pong with Power-Ups

## Overview

Welcome to the **Elevate Pong with Power-Ups** project! This repository contains the code for a modernized version of the classic Pong game, enhanced with exciting power-ups. This project is designed to help you deepen your understanding of C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) while learning the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) for graphics, UI, and more.

## Features

- **Speed Boosts**: Collect power-ups to increase your paddle's speed.
- **Paddle Size Alteration**: Temporary power-ups can change the size of your paddle, making it easier or harder to hit the ball.
- **Ball Direction Reversal**: Gain an edge by reversing the ball's direction with special power-ups.
